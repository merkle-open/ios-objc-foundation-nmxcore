#### Overall Developemnt requirements:
[ ] If you added new Header files, did you update `Header-ios-objc-foundation-nmxcore.h` or related header files, so the code documentation is able to retrieve your new files?
[ ] Did you write pretty printable code comments for added classes, properties or functions?
[ ] If you added properties, did you Nullability annotations? --> `_Nullable`, `_Nonnull`
[ ] If you added functions, did you Nullability annotations? --> `nullable`, `nonnull`, `null_resettable`, `null_unspecified`
[ ] Did you generate a new documentation file via `jazzy`-command?
[ ] Did you perform `pod lib lint NMXCore.podspec` and `pod lib lint NMXCoreDylib.podspec`
[ ] Did you test your code with Unit tests?
[ ] Did the test coverage increase / did maintain the same level? --> If not, why?

#### Release Management
[ ] Did you update the README.md with the latest version you are using
[ ] Did you perform `pod spec lint NMXCore.podspec` and `pod spec lint NMXCoreDylib.podspec`
[ ] Make the reviewer aware to `pod trunk push NMXCore.podspec --verbose` and `pod trunk push NMXCoreDylib.podspec --verbose` after the review. Or do it yourself.

#### Further Questions
- Is there a blog post?
- Does the knowledge base need an update?
- Does this add new dependencies which need to be added to the podspec file?
